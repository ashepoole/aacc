	<h2>Life is never ordinary.</h2>
	<p id="aboutbook">What begins with a college dropout bored of her mediocre routine soon becomes a fantastic series of vignettes about the unexpected ways that lives intersect. Filled with magical realism in the face of the cold reality of modern life, at their core these stories are about discovering something precious in the chaos of existence. A dream recaptured. A life on a new track. The absurdity of death. Laughter in the face of reality. With this series of intersecting vignettes, Inio Asano explores the ways in which modern life can be ridiculous and sublime, terrible and precious, wasted and celebrated. Amusing, melancholic, funny, strange, thought-provoking - Asano effortlessly shifts from one mood to another, creating stories and characters that are profoundly human and thus always involving. Beautifully drawn and melancholy as all get out, the comics equivalent of a Death Cab for Cutie album. Available in two translated volumes in North America.</p>

	<h2>Who is Inio Asano?</h2>
	<p>Inio Asano is a Japanese manga author, born in Ibaraki, Japan, in 1980. In 2001, his short story "Uchu kara Konnichiwa"" (Hello from Outer Space) won the first Sunday GX Rookie Prize. Later, GX published his series Subarashi Sekai, now available as "What a Wonderful World" from VIZ Media. Asano also created the acclaimed manga Solanin which was released as a feature film in Japan in April 2010, starring Aoi Miyazaki, as well as Oyasumi Punpun (Goodnight Punpun). He has also released works such as Hikari no Machi (City of Light), Nijigahara Holograph, and Umibe no Onna no Ko (A Girl on the Shore). He is known for his character driven, realist stories that range from slice of life stories to psychological horror. In 2001 he won the first prize in the GX competition for young manga artists. The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper described him as "one of the voices of his generation."</p>

	<h2>What others have said.</h2>
	<p class="reviewquote">Asano's beautifully drawn anthology follows up his Harvey and Eisner–nominated Solanin with more short stories about sullen teenagers and 20-somethings. If anything, the short story format makes Asano's mopey protagonists far more sympathetic. Some of the characters are more likable than others; in two related shorts, appealing punk rocker Horita gives up his dreams of becoming a rock star to put on a suit and tie, only to recant later in the book. In A Town of Many Hills, a bullied teen believes a talking crow is a death god encouraging her to commit suicide. Like many of the book's protagonists, the girl overcomes her death wish, but hers is the most triumphant victory in the volume. Asano's artwork is very attractive, frequently interspersing all-black panels with the characters' inner thoughts in white text. His teens' navel-gazing thoughts are prone to platitudes, but much less so here than in Solanin. What a Wonderful World is titled ironically, but its message to aimless and depressed young people is a positive one, told without preaching, and the artwork and strong storytelling make this another standout.</p>

	<p class="reviewpublisher"> - Stephen King</p>
	<p class="reviewquote">An aimless young woman is forced to find focus. A bullied middle-school student changes her social status through a desperate act. A middle-aged manga artist tries to hold onto what family he has as his assistant lets love slip through his fingers. A high-school girl’s part-time job selling her body puts her in the path of an unusual thief. These stories and more make up the first volume of Asano’s two-part manga anthology. Each tale is loosely connected with the next, sometimes obviously, sometimes so subtly that the connection is only spotted in the images between chapters.</p>

	<p class="reviewquote">Some might find what looks to be a mere collection of short stories to be a bit scattered, but by book’s end I personally saw him driving everything toward a single goal—something that quietly turns in the face of what everything in the world is saying and demurely gives it the finger.</p>
