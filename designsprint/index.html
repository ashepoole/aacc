				<h2>About Design Sprints</h2>
				<p>A design sprint is a new concept in the design world used to rapily create a prototype ready to be
					put through user testing. It was first developed at GV, who describes it as a "greatest hits" of
					business strategy, innovation, behavior science, design thinking, and more.</p>
				<p>A sprint is a five-day process in which each work day is dedicated to a new step in the process. The
					idea is that a problem is identified, and different solutions are rapidly developed.</p>
				<p>My Web Design 2 professor recently had my class go through this process over the course of about
					eight hours. The following is a documentation of this experience.</p>

				<h2>Understand</h2>
				<img class="spread" src="img/board.JPG"
					alt="My Web Design 2 class, working out a plan in front of a whiteboard.">
				<p>To begin, Professor Erik Dunham gave us a problem to solve. The scenario was that the Maryland Food
					Bank had hired us to create an app that would increase their online donations. We started by doing
					short interviews with each other, and writing down the given answers on post-it notes. We then
					arranged their answers into categories in an attempt to identify different issues somebody may have
					with donating online.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="hideme" id="s3">
				<h2>Diverge</h2>
				<img class="spread" src="img/teama.JPG" alt="Students comparing their ideas.">
				<p>Taking the feedback we had recieved from the class, we went our seperate ways to sketch out different
					ideas of how to solve the issues. I focused on trying to solve the user trust issue we saw on the
					whiteboard - that a lot of users didn't trust their information for online donations. We all ran
					through a Crazy Eights excersize, and </p>
			</div>

			<div class="hideme" id="s4">
				<h2>Decide</h2>
				<img class="spread" src="img/decide.jpg" alt="Ashton's idea for an app.">
				<p>For this stage, I grouped up with others in the class - Anna Copper, and Alexander Garcia, to compare
					ideas. Our goal at this stage was to choose ideas, and further flesh them out. We did this by voting
					on our favorite ideas from our three concepts.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="hideme" id="s5">
				<h2>Prototype</h2>
				<img class="spread" src="img/prototype.jpg"
					alt="A sketch of different screens on a phone, used to create a prototype. Next to it, a phone running Marvel's prototyping software, with our app on the screen.">
				<p>Based on the feedback we had recieved from each other, we began to work together to create a final
					concept.</p>
				<p>We used Marvel's prototyping app on our phones to do this - it allows you to add a layer of
					interactivity to still images, such as sketches. Through this tool, we were able to build a working
					prototype of our concept.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="hideme" id="s6">
				<h2>Validate</h2>
				<img class="spread" src="img/usertest.JPG" alt="Students conducting a user testing session.">
				<p>My group decided that I would be running the user test session, while Alexander took notes. Our
					professor used a random name picker to choose who we would be interviewing.</p>
				<p>During the test session, we were able to see the strengths and flaws in our design very clearly.
					While our plan was to help solve the issues that were brought up with user trust by keeping
					everything clean and approachable, our end-user commented that she felt like she wasn't being given
					enough information, and wanted to know the explicit details that we had kept simple.</p>
				<p>This was also good experience in the user testing process itself. Our app did not have a "back"
					button in the prototype, simply because we felt it wouldn't be neccecary for our test. However, that
					was the first thing our end-user searched for, and it's absense became a distraction and gave her a
					negative view of our app.</p>
				<p>While our app was not perfect, we were able to see these problems. If we were actually building this
					app, we could begin to solve them with a revision.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="hideme" id="s7">
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>This was a great experience in working with a team, as well as rapidly building a concept from the
					ground up. I'm very grateful to my professor for bringing this oppertunity to us. One of the reasons
					I signed up for my college's Web Design 2 class was that I was told we'd be working in groups, and
					having a group project on day one was fantastic.</p>
				<p>I'd also like to thank both Anna Cooper and Alexander Garcia. It was great working with you both.</p>
